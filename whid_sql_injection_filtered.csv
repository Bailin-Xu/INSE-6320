2010-26,WHID 2010-26: Russia Arrests Alleged Mastermind of RBS WorldPay Hack,"A fascinating story about a group of hackers who broke into the RBS WorldPay DBs through SQL Injection.  Russian authorities have nabbed the man accused of masterminding a coordinated global ATM heist of $9.5 million from Atlanta-based card processing company RBS WorldPay.  The hackers compromised RBS WorldPay‰Ûªs database encryption to raise the amount of funds available on the compromised cards, and boost their daily withdrawal limits. In some case, the hackers raised the limits to $500,000.  According to the indictment, Tsurikov conducted reconnaissance of the RBS network after Covelin provided him with information about vulnerabilities in the system. Pleshchuk and Covelin then worked on exploiting the vulnerabilities to obtain access. Pleschuk allegedly developed the method for reverse engineering the encrypted PINs.  Once the hackers raised the account limits, they provided an army of cashers with 44 cards programmed with the account details. On November 8 that year, the cashers simultaneously hit more than 2,000 ATMs, netting about $9.5 million in less than 12 hours.



The story did not specify the exact vulnerabilities exploited to manipulate the DB however the Indictment PDF (in the reference) lists actual SQL commands sent to the DBs (pages 10-11).

The mass compromise appears to have affected sites running a banner-ads module on top of Microsoft's Internet Information Services using ASP.net, said David Dede, head of malware research at Sucuri, a website monitoring firm.  The sites were infected using SQL injection exploits, which allow attackers to tamper with a server's database by typing commands into search boxes and other user-input fields. The hackers used the exploit to plant iframes in the compromised sites that redirected visitors to robint.us.

2009-42,WHID 2009-42: Puerto Rico sites redirected in a DNS attack,"Attacking web sites by going to the source, targeting DNS servers rather than the web sites themselves shows both the boldness of hackers as well as the fragility of the Internet.



While not new, DNS hijacking attacks took an important turn this year showing how much we rely on the web and now little we care for its protection. In the past DNS hijacking required complete control over the DNS server. In recent years most applications are controlled through a web interface, including DNS servers. Earlier this year attackers found an XSS vulnerability in a common DNS platform to hijack unused DNS entries for phishing



But this was only a small prelude to the real thing. CNet reports that this time hackers took over an entire TLD (Top Level Domain, or country) DNS server using SQL injection, virtually defacing the Puerto Rican site of companies such as Google and Microsoft.



The amazing story unfolds in the comments to CNet story, which outlines a mischievous professor and slow authorities who let him privatize and monetize on domain registration in Puerto Rico without any control.

For now we list them in a <a href=""/research-web-site-vuln"">separate page</a>, waiting for a place to be files in.</p>

<p>Uno presents a dilemma: he finds a vulnerability, exploits it to a limit and publish the results. Therefore the incident does not have a sizable outcome and not damage is done, but nevertheless it is interesting. We are not the only one to note that. Kasperski stressed the point the no data was actually compromised in their <a href=""http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575753"">response </a>to the event.

The SQL statement might be used in a hidden field, or generated on the fly by a client side script. In any case, it is extremely difficult to prevent alteration of the SQL statement by a user in such applications, making the applications highly vulnerable.</p>

2008-19,"WHID 2009-19: Kaspersky site breached using SQL injection, sensitive data exposed (Updated)","<p><em><strong>Update (Feb 22<sup>nd</sup> 2009)</strong></em> - We were probably not the only ones not satisfied with Kasperski official press release on the subject. An interesting <a href=""http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?discuss=208187633&amp;return=1"">report </a>on Kasperski viruslist blog by a person on the investigating team provides answers: the data was neither secured well nor the hacker incapable. The hacker made a mistake in his attack vector and decided to pursue no further. The data was available for any hacker who was really after it.</p>

<p>I must tkae my hat off to Kasperski for this frank analysis, which is very uncommon to companies who were breached and can really help to highlight the importance of application security.</p>

<hr />

<p><em><strong>Update (Feb 13<sup>th</sup> 2009)</strong></em> - Kasperski hired David Litchfield, a well known database security expert, to analyze the incident. In their <a href=""http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575753"">response, </a>Ksaperski point that no sensitive data was actually compromised  to the event. The report points that the hacker and others following his hints did try to access sensitive data but did not succeed. The carefully worded report does leave many questions open:</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>

<li>Was the data secured well, or were the hackers who tried to access it just not capable?</li>

<li>Was no data vulnerable or just ""sensitive data"" and if so what is the data that was exposed?</li>

<li>Did the investigation go back to check that no one hacked the system prior to the published incident, potentially abusing it and avoiding publication?</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>A researcher <a href=""http://hackersblog.org/2009/02/07/usakasperskycom-hacked-full-database-acces-sql-injection/"">found and exploited</a> a serious SQL injection vulnerability in US web site of Kasperski, an anti-virus software vendor, exposing the full customers database. Well, the full database actually as the list of tables exposed proves. <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/09/kaspersky_compromise_follow_up/"">Apparently</a>, the vulnerability existed for some time and the researched informed Kasperski about it to no avail before making it public.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is another example of how fatal is SQL injection. SQL Injection is considered one of the more well understood attack vectors, easy to find during a security review, and therefore easy to get rid of. However one of its variants, blind SQL injection, can appear everywhere in the application and not just in key pages managing sensitive information and expose the entire database, making a review and fix of the application from it much harder.</p>",,7-Feb-09,SQL Injection,Improper Input Handling,Leakage of Information,Technology,,No,,,Romania,,,,,

Unfortunately, there is always a first. In an attack which gives a whole new dimension to the term ""malicious"",hackers recently injected to the Epilepsy Foundation's Web site hundreds of pictures and links to pages with rapidly flashing images.</p>
<p>The breach caused severe migraines and near-seizure reactions in some site visitors who viewed the images. People with photosensitive epilepsy can get seizures when they're exposed to flickering images, a response also caused by some video games and cartoons.</p>
<p>The Attack_Method is only described as an exploit of a security hole in the foundation's publishing software. However, the attack looks very much like a variation of the popular iframe injection SQL bots, used for malice rather than profit, hinting that this was an SQL injection attack.</p>

<p>Very detailed records of geeks.com customers were stolen from the site. The records included name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, expiration date, and most notoriously, card verification number (CVV).</p>
<p>The interesting part is that the site had a Hacker Safe seal. The seal was revoked twice last year due to vulnerabilities, but restored after they where patched.

According to investigation papers Maksym Yastremskiy made approximately 11 million dollars from the hack!</p>
<hr />
<p>The TJX breach is one of most publicized hacking incident in recent years. However, until now it was not part of the Web Hacking Incidents Database. And for a good reason: early report described the hack as a war driving hack, in which the attackers drive around and find a wireless network not properly secured.</p>
<p>However new information from the trial of the identity theft ring leader Albert Gonzalez, reveals that in order to penetrate TJX data center from the captured end points, the hackers employed different techniques including password sniffing and SQL injection. The later justifies getting the TJX incident for the 1st time into WHID.</p>

Sometime between January and<br />August of 2007, names, addresses, credit and debit card data, and<br />passwords of an unknown number of people, including 169 New Hampshire<br />residents were stolen from the site.</p>
<p>Why New Hampshire? Because the company has to report to the<br />authorities there about the incidents, but only specify the number of<br />individuals from this state affected. Why only New Hampshire? Since<br />regulations and bills requiring disclosures exist in many states, one<br />would expect that the company would have to provide such a testimonial<br />in many states.

2007-82,WHID 2007-82: An SQL injection Mass Robot,"<p>An SQL injection robot is running wild and has already hacked hundreds of thousands of web sites. Since the robot plants malicious code in infected sites, its traces can be found by Googling for a name of Chinese sites referred to in malicious code.</p>

<p>As a security practitioner I often see SQL injection bots, and many times when I install ModSecurity, an open source application firewall but this bot is unique in the way it exploits web sites. It is easier to perform a wide scale attack by exploiting the least common denominator, which in the hacking world is the operating system. As a result most SQL bots tend to try to use SQL injection vectors that will enable issuing OS commands. A good example is a <a href=""http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21799/discuss"">Cacti vulnerability</a>: since it allows an OS command to be issued I often see bots looking for it in the wild. This attack is the first I have seen in which the actual attack vector is SQL based. The bot is modifying every record it has access to into a malicious code in the hope that it will be fetched and displayed by the application to its users.</p>

<p>A byproduct if this vector is that is that results are catastrophic for the site owners. While in a case of common defacement attacks restoring (or recreating) the homepage is all it required to get back to business, in this case the whole database is ruined. Considering the scope of the attack and that restoring the database, if it was ever backup, requires much more expertise, the overall damage of this attack is very high.</p>

Many of us have come to rely on open source software, which is useful, feature reach and free. It enables us access to tools available to a few only a couple of years ago. The downside is that this easy availability means that many use the tools without having the time, resources and expertise to protect them. Systems such as <a href=""http://www.phpbb.com"">phpBB</a> and <a href=""http://www.wordpress.org"">WordPress</a> are good<br />examples of very popular open source systems that require constant<br />attention in order to maintain secure.</p>
<p>I am sure that the guys at Light Blue Touchpaper have the expertise to protect their WordPress installation, but they donåÕt have the time. They made the compromise between ease of management of their web site and its security. Actually my <a href=""http://blog.shezaf.com"">personal blog</a> might be just as vulnerable, since as I write this I am very much not paying attention to its security.</p>
<p>Apart from, or actually because of  the fact that the victims are security experts, this story is noteworthy due to two additional twists in the plot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero day exploit in the wild - the attacker penetrated twice, once using a known SQL injection vulnerability, but the second time using a yet unknown vulnerability in WordPress, which was reverse engineered and published for the first time by the people at Light Blue Touchpaper.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The researchers found that they can use Google to retrieve the hashed password of the hacker. Google has become so big that it actually allows efficient encrypted passwords lookup.</li>

2007-38,WHID 2007-38: Gentoo takes server offline due to security vulnerabilities,"<p>This gem is very interesting since it happened on Gentoo servers. It therefore combines transparency into the incident that only an open source project can offer with the importance and resource of a large one. As a result we have a detailed report about the vulnerability, exploit attempts and event people shouting at each other during the patching process. <br />What can we learn from this? That no server is secure, and that patching is hard.

Hackers used an SQL Injection vulnerability in the web site to steal 1.6 million users and passwords of the site.

2004-17,WHID 2004-17: The CardSystems breach was an SQL Injection hack (Updated),"<p><em><strong>Update (May 27th 2009)</strong></em> - The CardSystems incident is refusing to die. Merrick Back is now <a href=""http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/05/26/Merrick.pdf"">suing Savvis</a> for certifying CardSystems as CISP compliant while it systems where wide open. CISP is a VISA program for certifying credit card processing systems which existed prior to PCI DSS.</p>
<p>The actual damage to an organization of an attack is rarely disclosed, and coverage focuses on the Number_of_Records stolen. In the court documents Merrick reveals that its own damage from the CardSystems incident was $16,000,000! The money was paid to card holders to compensate for losses and for legal fees and fines.</p>
<p>The case is also interesting as it put to test the liability of the certifying entity (in this case Savvis) resulting from assessing. The results may have profound influence on the PCI QSA market and therefore PCI itself. David Navetta posts an <a href=""http://infoseccompliance.com/2009/06/03/merrick-bank-v-savvis-analysis-of-the-merrick-bank-complaint/"">excellent legal analysis</a> of the potential implications of the lawsuit.</p>
<hr />
<p>This entry is a very important one. Most are already familiar with the infamous CardSystems incident where hackers stole 263,000 credit card numbers, exposed 40 million more and several million dollars fraudulent credit and debit card purchases had been made with these counterfeit cards. As a result of the breach CardSystems nearly went out of business and was eventually purchased by PayByTouch. CardSystems is considered by many the most severe publicized information security breach ever and it caused company share holders, financial institutes and card holders damage of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>But since the publication of the incident a year ago the way in which the breach occurred remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Recently new articles about the case (listed below) revealed that SQL injection was used by the attackers to install malicious script on the CardSystems web application database which where scheduled to run every four days, extract records, zip them and export them to an FTP site.</p>
<p>This is one of the most stunning examples where a web application security hole was used to launch a targeted attack in order to steal money.</p>
